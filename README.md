# Project-Pandor

Project Pandor is a test mission hybrid for ARMA 3, which will be used to assist in practice and understanding of mission making in said game. This project is expected to become large and bloated while I figure out things, and borrow code (with credit) from other mission makers. Please review the LICENSE section to learn more about the original code and code that I have created myself.
